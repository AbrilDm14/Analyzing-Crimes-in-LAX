# Analyzing-Crimes-in-LAX

We have been asked to support the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by analyzing their crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior. They plan to use your insights to allocate resources effectively to tackle various crimes in different areas.

By developing an analysis, we are required to produce insights about crimes in LAX:
- How crime varies by area, crime type, victim age, time of day and victim descent.
- Visualize the distribution of crimes on a map.
- Provide recommendations for the LAPD to focus that might help to predict criminal activities.
